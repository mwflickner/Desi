\chapter{Original Proposal}
My project for 402 will be called Desi and will be an iOS application built on the Parse SDK. The purpose of Desi is to help a group of people manage their responsibilities. A user of the app belongs to a group with other users. With each group, there are tasks, each of which has a specific user responsible for completing that task. That person is called the Desi. A point is given to the Desi upon completion of his task. Users can volunteer to complete a task if they are not the Desi and earn double points. Points can be used as a payment for the Desi to opt-out of his task.

\section{Introduction}
Desi is a system in which a user logs in to create group with other and then create/complete task in a group with those other users. Points are awarded for completing tasks and can be used as currency to opt-out of an assigned task.

\section{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{General}
\subsubsection{Run on an iOS Device}
Desi must be able to run on a device running iOS.
\subsubsection{Make network calls to the backend}
Desi must be able to make network calls to retrieve or save data.
\subsubsection{Persistant Data}
Desi must make use of the mySQLite iOS datastore to make user data persistent.
\subsubsection{Handle Network Errors}
Desi must be able to function if
