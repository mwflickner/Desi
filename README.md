# Desi

### About
Desi is an iOS application written in Swift and built on the Parse SDK.
The idea for Desi came from the minds of Matthew Flickner, Trevor Ergas, and Matt Nachtigal.

### Purpose
The purpose of Desi (short for Designinator) is to help a group of people manage their responsibilities. An example would be a group roommates using Desi to manage and delegate their household chores.

### How It Works
A user of the app belongs to a group with other users. With each group, there are tasks that group members can create, each of which has a specific user responsible for completing that task. That person is called the Desi. Points are awarded to the Desi upon completion of his task. Users who are not the Desi can volunteer to complete a task and earn double points. Points can be used as a payment for the Desi to opt-out of his task.
